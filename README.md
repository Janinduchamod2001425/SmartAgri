# Genetic Engineering

The Genetic Engineering Integration feature in the AgroPro system offers farmers valuable tools and resources to enhance their crops through genetic modifications. Farmers input details about their crop type, desired traits, and local environmental conditions into the system.
In response, the system provides information on genetically modified (GM) crop varieties that meet their needs,
along with step-by-step guidelines for applying genetic engineering techniques. It also includes local regulatory information,
resources for further support, and impact analysis on potential benefits. By integrating this feature,
AgroPro enables farmers to access advanced genetic solutions tailored to their specific conditions,
improving crop yield, pest resistance, and drought tolerance, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
